# Vehicle-Movement-Analysis-and-Insight-Generation-in-a-College-Campus
The primary objective of this project is to develop an Edge AI-based solution that can analyze vehicle movement.

All the codes are executed using Google-Collab and Jypter Notebook 

Best.pt file is the Yolo model trained from the custom dataset which is used in the main code for vehicle detection and text extraction in data.ipynb file

YOLO_MODEL.ipynb is for training custom dataset 

car4.mp4 is example video for demostration of the code
